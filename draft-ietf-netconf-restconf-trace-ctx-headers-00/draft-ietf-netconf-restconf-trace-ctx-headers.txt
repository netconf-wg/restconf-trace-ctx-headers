1.  Introduction

   Network automation and management systems commonly consist of
   multiple sub-systems and together with the network devices they
   manage, they effectively form a distributed system.  Distributed
   tracing is a methodology implemented by tracing tools to follow,
   analyze and debug operations, such as configuration transactions,
   across multiple distributed systems.  An operation is uniquely
   identified by a trace-id and through a trace context, carries some
   metadata about the operation.  Propagating this "trace context"
   between systems enables forming a coherent view of the entire
   operation as carried out by all involved systems.

   The W3C has defined two HTTP headers (traceparent and tracestate) for
   context propagation that are useful for distributed systems like the
   ones defined in [RFC8309].  The goal of this document is to adopt
   this W3C specification for the RESTCONF protocol.

   This document does not define new HTTP extensions but makes those
   defined in [W3C-Trace-Context] optional headers for the RESTCONF
   protocol.

   In [I-D.draft-rogaglia-netconf-trace-ctx-extension-03], the NETCONF
   protocol extension is defined and we will re-use several of the YANG
   and XML objects defined in that document for RESTCONF.  Please refer
   to that document for additional context and example applications.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT","SHOULD","SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  RESTCONF Extensions

   A RESTCONF server SHOULD support trace context traceparent header as
   defined in [W3C-Trace-Context].

   A RESTCONF server SHOULD support trace context tracestate header as
   defined in [W3C-Trace-Context].

2.1.  Errors handling

   The RESTCONF server SHOULD follow the "Processing Model for Working
   with Trace Context" as specified in [W3C-Trace-Context].

   If the server rejects the RPC because of the trace context headers
   values, the server MUST return an rpc-error with the following
   values:

     error-tag:      operation-failed
     error-type:     protocol
     error-severity: error

   Additionally, the error-info tag SHOULD contain a relevant details
   about the error.

   Finally, the sx:structure defined in
   [I-D.draft-rogaglia-netconf-trace-ctx-extension-03] SHOULD be present
   in any error message from the server.

   Example of a badly formated trace context extension using [RFC8040]
   example B.2.1:

     POST /restconf/data/example-jukebox:jukebox/library HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.com
     Content-Type: application/yang-data+json
     traceparent: SomeBadFormatHere
     tracestate: OrSomeBadFormatHere

     {
       "example-jukebox:artist" : [
         {
           "name" : "Foo Fighters"
         }
       ]
     }

   And the expected error message:

    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    Date: Tue, 20 Jun 2023 20:56:30 GMT
    Server: example-server
    Content-Type: application/yang-data+json

    { "ietf-restconf:errors" : {
        "error" : [
          {
            "error-type" : "protocol",
            "error-tag" : "operation-failed",
            "error-severity" : "error",
            "error-message" :
            "OTLP traceparent attribute incorrectly formatted",
            "error-info": {
              "ietf-netconf-otlp-context:meta-name" : "traceparent",
              "ietf-netconf-otlp-context:meta-value" :
              "SomeBadFormatHere",
              "ietf-netconf-otlp-context:error-type" :
              "ietf-netconf-otlp-context:bad-format"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }

2.2.  Trace Context header versionning

   This extension refers to the [W3C-Trace-Context] trace context
   capability.  The W3C traceparent and trace-state headers include the
   notion of versions.  It would be desirable for a RESTCONF client to
   be able to discover the one or multiple versions of these headers
   supported by a server.  We would like to achieve this goal avoiding
   the deffinition of new RESTCONF capabilities for each headers'
   version.

   [I-D.draft-rogaglia-netconf-trace-ctx-extension-03] defines a pair
   YANG modules that SHOULD be included in the YANG library per
   [RFC8525] of the RESTCONF server supporting the RESTCONF Trace
   Context extension that will refer to the headers' supported versions.
   Future updates of this document could include additional YANG modules
   for new headers' versions.
