1.  Introduction

   Network automation and management systems commonly consist of
   multiple sub-systems and together with the network devices they
   manage, they effectively form a distributed system.  Distributed
   tracing is a methodology implemented by tracing tools to follow,
   analyze and debug operations, such as configuration transactions,
   across multiple distributed systems.  An operation is uniquely
   identified by a trace-id and through a trace context, carries some
   metadata about the operation.  Propagating this "trace context"
   between systems enables forming a coherent view of the entire
   operation as carried out by all involved systems.

   The W3C has defined two HTTP headers (traceparent and tracestate) for
   context propagation that are useful for distributed systems like the
   ones defined in [RFC8309].  The goal of this document is to adopt
   this W3C specification for the RESTCONF protocol.

   This document does not define new HTTP extensions but makes those
   defined in [W3C-Trace-Context] optional headers for the RESTCONF
   protocol.

   In [I-D.draft-rogaglia-netconf-trace-ctx-extension-03], the NETCONF
   protocol extension is defined and we will re-use several of the YANG
   and XML objects defined in that document for RESTCONF.  Please refer
   to that document for additional context and example applications.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT","SHOULD","SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  RESTCONF Extensions

   A RESTCONF server SHOULD support trace context traceparent header as
   defined in [W3C-Trace-Context].

   A RESTCONF server SHOULD support trace context tracestate header as
   defined in [W3C-Trace-Context].

2.1.  Error Handling

   The RESTCONF server SHOULD follow the "Processing Model for Working
   with Trace Context" as specified in [W3C-Trace-Context].

   If the server rejects the RPC because of the trace context headers,
   the server MAY return an rpc-error with the following values:

     error-tag:      operation-failed
     error-type:     protocol
     error-severity: error

   Additionally, the error-info tag SHOULD contain a relevant details
   about the error.

   Finally, the sx:structure defined in
   [I-D.draft-rogaglia-netconf-trace-ctx-extension-03] SHOULD be present
   in any error message from the server.

2.2.  Trace Context header versionning

   This extension refers to the [W3C-Trace-Context] trace context
   capability.  The W3C traceparent and trace-state headers include the
   notion of versions.  It would be desirable for a RESTCONF client to
   be able to discover the one or multiple versions of these headers
   supported by a server.  We would like to achieve this goal avoiding
   the deffinition of new RESTCONF capabilities for each headers'
   version.

   [I-D.draft-rogaglia-netconf-trace-ctx-extension-03] defines a pair
   YANG modules that SHOULD be included in the YANG library per
   [RFC8525] of the RESTCONF server supporting the RESTCONF Trace
   Context extension that will refer to the headers' supported versions.
   Future updates of this document could include additional YANG modules
   for new headers' versions.

3.  Security Considerations

   There are no YANG modules specified in this document, even though the
   functionality described herein relates to the network management
   protocol RESTCONF [RFC8040].  This is because the only functionality
   described are additional HTTP headers, and those cannot be described
   using YANG.There are still some security considerations worth
   mentioning, however.

   The traceparent and tracestate headers make it easier to track the
   flow of requests and their downstream effect on other systems.  This
   is indeed the whole point with these headers.  This knowledge could
   also be of use to bad actors that are working to build a map of the
   managed network.

   The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement
   secure transport is TLS [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   All privacy and security consideration in [W3C-Trace-Context] apply
   to this document.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

              <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8309>.

Appendix A.  Example RESTCONF calls

   All examples from [RFC8040] Appendix B could be recreated in this
   seciton by adding the new header described in this document.  We
   selected one example from that document as reference.

A.1.  Successful creation New Data Resources (from section B.2.1 in
      [RFC8040])

   To create a new "artist" resource within the "library" resource, the
   client might send the following request:

    POST /restconf/data/example-jukebox:jukebox/library HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    Content-Type: application/yang-data+json
    traceparent: 00-405062f633be64ee006089dfca95a153-e021f9e263aad8e2-01
    tracestate: vendorname1=opaqueValue1,vendorname2=opaqueValue2

    {
      "example-jukebox:artist" : [
        {
          "name" : "Foo Fighters"
        }
      ]
    }

   If the resource is created, the server might respond as follows:

    HTTP/1.1 201 Created
    Date: Thu, 26 Jan 2017 20:56:30 GMT
    Server: example-server
    Location: https://example.com/restconf/data/\
        example-jukebox:jukebox/library/artist=Foo%20Fighters
    Last-Modified: Thu, 26 Jan 2017 20:56:30 GMT
    ETag: "b3830f23a4c"
    traceparent: 00-405062f633be64ee006089dfca95a153-e021f9e263aad8e2-01
    tracestate: vendorname1=opaqueValue1,vendorname2=opaqueValue2

A.2.  Unsuccessful creation New Data Resources (from section B.2.1 in
      [RFC8040])

   [W3C-Trace-Context] specifies that vendor MAY validate the tracestate
   header and that invalid headers MAY be discarded.  In Section Error
   handling (Section 2.1), it is stated that servers MAY return an
   error.  Let's assume that is our implementation.

   Example of a badly formated tracestate header using [RFC8040] example
   B.2.1, which by following :

    POST /restconf/data/example-jukebox:jukebox/library HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    Content-Type: application/yang-data+json
    traceparent: 00-405062f633be64ee006089dfca95a153-e021f9e263aad8e2-01
    tracestate: SomeBadFormatHere

    {
      "example-jukebox:artist" : [
        {
          "name" : "Foo Fighters"
        }
      ]
    }

   And the expected error message:

    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    Date: Tue, 20 Jun 2023 20:56:30 GMT
    Server: example-server
    Content-Type: application/yang-data+json

    { "ietf-restconf:errors" : {
        "error" : [
          {
            "error-type" : "protocol",
            "error-tag" : "operation-failed",
            "error-severity" : "error",
            "error-message" :
            "OTLP traceparent attribute incorrectly formatted",
            "error-info": {
              "ietf-netconf-otlp-context:meta-name" : "tracestate",
              "ietf-netconf-otlp-context:meta-value" :
              "SomeBadFormatHere",
              "ietf-netconf-otlp-context:error-type" :
              "ietf-netconf-otlp-context:bad-format"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
